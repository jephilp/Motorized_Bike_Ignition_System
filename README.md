# Motorized_Bike_Ignition_System
Created to replace the stock ignition with minimal modification and increase performance.

# Current Progress
We have a prototype being bench tested and bugs are being worked out.
Live testing will hopefully be started by the end of the month.

# Requirements
The system runs natively on arduino, specfically the Uno or Nano since they share similar chips.

They run alongside a 3D printed hall sensor mount holding a sensor for timing.
You will need at least some circuitry knowledge, as well as a computer and soldering supplies.
