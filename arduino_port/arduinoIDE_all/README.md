# Electronic Ignition System: Arduino Port @ [GitHub](https://github.com/jephilp/Electronic-Ignition-System/tree/arduino_direct_port)
*This repository is currently hosting pseudo-code and unfinished scripts.*

The original code was built to be run on a 4 stroke engine on an Arduino uno with wasted spark.

# Conditions
-Single pickup (we are using a hall sensor)
-Single interrupt and single output
-Runs a coil on plug system
-Lightweight enough to run on an Attiny chip

# Code listed
-Original Code is the code from the source online
-tested_running is code ported to arduino nano for a custom test board
-tested_running_attiny84a is code lightened to run on an Attiny84a chip
